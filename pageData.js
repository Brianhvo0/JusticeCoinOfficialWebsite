    question: "What am I donating when I run JusticeCoin?",
    answer: "Your computer doesn’t use all of its processing power all the time. JusticeCoin uses some of your idle power to “mine” Monero. Mining stores data from verifying financial transactions by solving complicated math problems, and your computer receives cryptocurrency for the service. This cryptocurrency is exchanged for real dollars, and that’s what we donate."
  },
  {
    question: "Why are you mining Monero?",
    answer: "Monero has a relatively stable value and is an ASIC-resistant cryptocurrency. This means computers specifically designed for mining cryptocurrency are banned, preventing any one user from establishing a monopoly over the currency and allowing personal computers to mine cryptocurrency efficiently. The open source code base for Monero mining software made this a tenable project for our team."
  },
  {
    question: "How much CPU power does this take?",
    answer: "The processing power used with the web miner is set to a default 50% of the maximum possible amount, so the final value is personalized for your computer. The desktop app gives you even more control, with settings for low, medium, and high power."
  },
  {
    question: "Isn't it faster to just donate cash directly?",
    answer: "JusticeCoin is a new platform for decentralized fundraising, so anyone can make a difference from anywhere. We strive to inform people about the positive impacts cryptocurrency can have for social good."
